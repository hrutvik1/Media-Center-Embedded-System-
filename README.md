# Media-Center-Embedded-System-
An embedded system project written in C. Utilizes GPIO and a joystick on the MCB1700 board to display pictures, play audio, and play rock paper scissors on an LCD. (NXP LPC1700 family ARM Cortex-M3 processor).

These files represent the crux of the project (image gallery, rock paper scissors, audio player). There were many files that came with the Keil development tools that handle the functinoality of the peripherials, LCD, etc but they are not included here due to copyright.
